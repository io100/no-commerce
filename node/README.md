## Vision

### No Commerce

Other E-Commerce Solutions:

- Suck 
- Don’t have the flexibility for skinning or themeing
- Don’t connect to accounting software such as quickbooks
- Have really bad documentation or very finicky apis / state machines
- Don’t have robust reporting and analytics
- Don’t have robust options to discount products and run promos across product line
- Terribly vague errors 

No Commerce solves these issues and more. We make it easy for a contractor or in-house developer to easily build a custom front end cart with the help of our API.

Our endpoints are very modular making it easy to add more endpoints or modify existing. We use Javascript / Node because it’s ubiquitous. 

We make it very easy to add items, customers, and checkout as well as include a very powerful admin panel with robust reporting and charts powered by libraries such as D3.

We incorporate a very robust dev environment ready to deploy to AWS which includes nginx, docker, ansible.

Our goal is for you to focus on the front-end so your branding is on point so you can grow your customer base very easily.
